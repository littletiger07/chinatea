            <p>Chinese people are believed to have enjoyed tea drinking for more than 4,000 years. 
            Legend has it that Yan Di, one of three rulers in ancient times, tasted all kinds of herbs to find medical cures. 
            One day,as he was being poisoned by some herb he had ingested; a drop of water from a tea tree dripped into his mouth
             and he was saved. For a long time, tea was used as an herbal medicine. During the Western Zhou Dynasty, 
            it was a religious offering. During the Spring and Autumn Period, people ate fresh tea leaves as vegetables. 
            With the popularization of Buddhism from the Three Kingdoms to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, 
            its refreshing effect made it a favorite among monks in Za-Zen meditation.</p>

            <p>Tea as a drink prospered during the Tang Dynasty, and tea shops became popular. A major event of this time was the completion 
            of Tea Classics, the cornerstone of Chinese tea culture, by Lu Yu, Tea Sage of China. This little book details rules concerning 
            various aspects of tea, such as growth areas for tea trees, wares and skills for processing and tasting of tea, the history of 
            Chinese tea and quotations from other records, comments on tea from various places, and notes on what occasions tea wares should be 
            complete and when some wares could be omitted.</p>

            <p>During the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought tea seeds from Zhejiang Province to Japan. Later in the Southern Song Dynasty, 
            Zen masters brought tea procedures and wares from China to Japan, promoting the initiation of the Japanese tea ceremony. In the Song
            Dynasty, Arabic merchants exported tea from Quanzhou, Fujian Province. In the Ming Dynasty, tea was sold to Southeast Asian and South 
            1African countries. In 1610 it went to Europe via Macau in a Dutch merchant ship. Thus it became an international drink.</p>
